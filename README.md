# Kaggle-MachineLearningCS7CS4

I have used a functional programming approach and tried to make several files but at the end had to do all the coding in one file only.
preprocessing.py Should run out of the box on a windows machine in Spyder(Python 3.7)

One should have the following libraries:
    Tensorflow
    Keras
    Sklearn
    numpy
    pandas
